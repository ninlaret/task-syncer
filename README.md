</p>

A tiny library made for a single purpose: synchronize tasks between different task systems (notion, todoist, habitica, gitlab and so on).
All you have to do is to configure synchronization directions and add your own systems using interfaces, or use existing implementations.

The minimum required PHP version is PHP 8.3.

The only supported parameters are name and status of the task.

Installation
